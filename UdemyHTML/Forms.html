<!-- form properties:

	 method - what HTTP method (get/post) (default = GET) -->
	<form action="http://wikipedia.org" method="GET">
	<!-- Inputs can do all sorts of things, depending on type.
		 The name attribute will tell what name to give the data that
		 is gathered from that input. Placeholder puts some text into the field to give the user a hint. 
		 Notice that the input elements are wrapped in a label, which
		 is used to further enhance the UX. -->
		<label>
			Username:
			<input name="username" type="text" placeholder="username">
		</label>
		<label>
			Password:
			<input name="password" type="password" placeholder="password">
		</label>
		<input type="submit">

<!-- The following is an alternate syntax that can be used with forms and input fields, specifying an id for the input element and a for attribute for the label. As long as the for property matches the id property, the label will be attached to the input element. 

The required attribute tells the browser to enforce that the form will not submit until that element has been filled. This type of validation is called presence validation: it makes sure something is there. There are also type validations, which is what happens if we set "type" to "email". -->

		<label for="username">Username:</label>
		<input name="username" type="text" id="username" placeholder="username" required>
		<label for="password">Password:</label>
		<input name="password" type="password" id="password" placeholder="password" required>
		<br>
		<label for="email">Email:</label>
		<input name="email" type="email" id="email" placeholder="email" required>
		<input type="submit">
