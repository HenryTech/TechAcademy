<!-- radio buttons 
By naming radio buttons the same thing, they get grouped and only one in the group can be selected. 

Note the button at the bottom, which even though it's not a submit type, since it's at the tail end of the form, will act as a submit button. 

Value tells the browser what to call that choice, as can be seen in the url when the button is clicked. -->
	
	<form action="">
		<p>Do you prefer cats or dogs?</p>
		<label for="dogs">Dogs: </label>
		<input name="petChoice" id="dogs" type="radio" value="DOGS">
		<label for="cats">Cats: </label>
		<input name="petChoice" id="cats" type="radio" value="CATS">
		
<!-- select tag 
This lets us create dropdown menus.

Unless some options are set, the dropdown menu will be empty.
Once a name is provided, the choice will be saved as that name (see url when go button is clicked. In this case, whatever is chosen will be saved as "color".

I've also added a mood dropdown selector, which, instead of saving an emoticon under mood, it will save the value ("happy", "neutral", "sad"). -->

		<p>What's your favorite color?</p>
		<select name="color">
			<option>Red</option>
			<option>Orange</option>
			<option>Yellow</option>
		</select>

		<p>What's your current mood?</p>
		<select name="mood">
			<option value="happy">:)</option>
			<option value="neutral">:|</option>
			<option value="sad">:(</option>
		</select>

		

	

<!-- textarea tag 
These are used to create a space for the user to write prose = more than one line. Rows and cols attributes will control the size of the text box. 

It will be saved as whatever the name is set to. -->
		<textarea name="paragraph" id="" cols="50" rows="10"></textarea>

		<button>Go!</button>

	</form>
