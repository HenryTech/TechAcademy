<!-- While this layout looks great at sm size and above, at xs, the text just stretches too far in relation to the headline and icons. So here, I've added a .col-xs-offset to give what look like substantial margins at xs size, making the elements look more like proper blocks of text. This screws over all the other sizes, though. It also makes the xs size layout look crowded to the right.

First things first, let's get that xs layout looking better. If we're already offsetting 3, then column size of 6 should center it nicely, right? Hence, .col-xs-6. 

Now we have the problem of that offset, which keeps going at all sizes larger than xs. Gotta clear that sucker! .col-sm-offset-0 clears it for sm and greater sizes. -->
