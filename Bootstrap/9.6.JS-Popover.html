			<h3>Our Mission</h3>
<!-- I'm going to set up a popover in a button here. If it's being used inside an element that has a button group or an input group class, then you have to use a data-container. We should also add a data-toggle and data-placement (which can be top, bottom, left or right) so that we are able to turn this on in our JavaScript. I can also add a title to the popover with data-title. Just like with tooltips, we have to go turn this on in script.js, so check over there for more.

Nice! But the user has to click directly on the button to clear the popover. If I use a link instead, the user will be able to click anywhere on the page to get rid of the popover. Let's make a link instead, by using an anchor tag. Different elements are used, though! We need to include a role and tabindex for SRs and folks who tab around. Tabindex is always set to a number and determines in what order elements will be focused if the user is navigating the page using the tab key. Tabindex=0 makes it the first element selected. -1 would make it un-selectable with tabbing. I also have to add data-trigger for a link popover.
