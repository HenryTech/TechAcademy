<!-- I have moved General Health so that it is now the first section. This completely borks the spacing, however, once we hit the sm size. The 4th element winds up getting offset lower than everything else and it looks wrong. At md size and above, though it still looks fine.

Enter .clearfix! The problem is that the "Exotic Pets" part doesn't have enough content and that's messing up spacing right after it. Totally fixes the problem, HOWEVER, now when we go to md size and above, it screws up differently (the column just after Exotic Pets on the first line is a blank space). Our 6-column layout gets borked as well. So, to fix this, I've added (to that same .clearfix div) a .visible-sm-block (could be hidden instead of visible, could be inline-block or inline instead of block).

That .visible or .hidden is really useful if you want to hide elements at certain breakpoints. Maybe at xs I just want those icons to go away? Easy enough to accomplish with .hidden-xs. -->
