<!-- I want to put all of this content in an accordion, but first I'm going to put in a button that will toggle this section of the page on and off. I give it an ID to refer to a section of the page I'll later define (exoticpets1, so it doesn't get mixed up with exoticpets, which is used in the accordion later) and I make sure to set the role to button so that SRs can understand. Of course we need to pass data along to JavaScript, so data-toggle is added with "collapse". Finally we need to set up SR accessibility with some aria settings (will not be expanded on loading and will control #exoticpets). Oh yeah! And throw a label in there "Exotic Pets".

Now we'll create a wrapper for the first part of our content, #exoticpets. Gotta make it a .collapse and give it an ID, of course. Now we have a nice button to click and content that doesn't show up until that button is clicked, and disappears when it's clicked again.

To create the accordion, we have to make a wrapping div for all of this. I gave it ID of #accordion, but you could use whatever ID you felt was appropriate, and the class of .panel-group is necessary.

Each area that we want to include in the accordion is going to get its own div that uses panels as well as a contextual color. So we need to create a child .panel div and something like .panel-default, but you could use .panel-primary, .panel-success, .panel-info, etc. Inside each .panel div, we need a div for the heading as well as a div for the content. My heading div, as you'll notice, has a role of tab (for SRs) and a specific ID I'll use later.

I'm going to take the button I made earlier and use it as the .panel-title. Since it's not going to be a button anymore, I can remove the .btn .btn-primary. We also need to identify the parent so that JavaScript will know what the hell is going on, so data-parent is set.

Now let's add the content part in a .panel-collapse div wrapper. I also use .collapse, and then throw in .in, which is the animation class for this element. I also added arialabeledby and referred to the ID I created earlier, so SRs can read the label.

Now I have to make another child div with .panel-body for the actual content.

I have to repeat the above process for each chunk of content, and then we'll have an accordion!

In order to make only one of them show up at first, I have to remove the .in from all the ones I want to be hidden at first (that's in the .panel-collapse div).

Oops! Data-parent refers to an ID, so I've gone through and change data-parent="accordion" to data-parent="#accordion". This makes it so that each element, when clicked on, will make the other elements disappear. Also, any of the tabs that aren't getting expanded at the beginning should have .collapsed added to their anchor tags.
